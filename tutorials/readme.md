# CTO Benchmark Tutorials: Getting Started
Welcome to the tutorial notebooks for the Clinical Trial Outcome (CTO) Benchmark!

To help you quickly get started exploring and using the CTO dataset, we've prepared two Jupyter Notebook tutorials that you can easily run in Google Colab.

Choose a Notebook to Begin:

We recommend starting with the getting_started_cto_vs_top.ipynb notebook if you are new to the CTO Benchmark or want a quick introduction. For users interested in a more comprehensive exploration and full experimental setup, the full_experiments.ipynb notebook provides detailed guidance.

Click on one of the badges below to open the corresponding notebook directly in Google Colab:

- getting_started_cto_vs_top.ipynb [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chufangao/CTOD/blob/main/tutorials/getting_started_cto_vs_top.ipynb): (Recommended for Beginners)
  - This notebook provides a basic introduction to the CTO dataset and demonstrates how to compare your model's performance against top-performing models on the benchmark. It's a great starting point for understanding the dataset structure and getting hands-on experience.


- full_experiments.ipynb [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chufangao/CTOD/blob/main/tutorials/full_experiments.ipynb): (For In-depth Exploration)
  - This notebook offers a more detailed walkthrough of the experimental setup for the CTO benchmark. It covers more advanced techniques, full experimental procedures, and provides insights into reproducing the results presented in the CTO paper.

Instructions:

Click on the badge of the notebook you wish to explore. This will open the notebook in Google Colab in your web browser.
Follow the instructions within the notebook. Each notebook contains step-by-step explanations and code cells to guide you through the tutorial.
Run the code cells sequentially to execute the notebook and see the results. You can modify the code and experiment with different parameters as you learn.
We hope these tutorials are helpful in getting you started with the CTO Benchmark. Happy exploring!
